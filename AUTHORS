Inyoka was originally created in 2007 for ubuntuusers.de.

In order to make Inyoka open source, efforts started in 2013 to create a
default theme that will eventually be shipped with Inyoka.

Here is a list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS -- people who have worked hard
to bring the theme to its current state and generally made the default Inyoka
theme that much better:

    Christoph Volkert <inyoka@christoph-volkert.de>
    Markus Holtermann <info@markusholtermann.eu>
    Sarah Blume <lyra2108@gmail.com>
    SÃ¶ren Wegener
    Sujeevan Vijayakumaran <https://svij.org>
